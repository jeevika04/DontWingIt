    <h1>What is this?</h1>
    <div class = "indented explanation">
        DontWingIt was built with one goal in mind: to make accessible web content easier; So people don't wing it. 
        DontWingIt tries to make development easier through gamification. We reward our users with points as they complete tasks. 
        <h2>Who should you be?</h2>
        Just about anyone who wants to make an accessible website. While our target audience is anyone, our product works best with absolute beginners. 
        Beginners are able to benefit from all our services we provide (learning component, gamification, development process guide, issue tracking).

    <h1>Product format</h1>
    <div class = "indented explanation">
        Accessibility should be built in to your website. As such, you need to be thinking about accessibility every step of the development process.
        The development ideology our product outlines, and you will be following is design, develop, test.  
    </div>
    <div class = "indented explanation">
        <div class = "design reference">
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <div class = "indented expanation">
                As the first phase of the development process, you can walk in with absolutely no ideas. Here, you will think about everything you want your product to have.
                Since this is not a product purely for accessibility, but for developing in an accessible manor, you will include both general features, and accessibility features.
                You can continue to add features throughout the entire development process. Features you add will show up in the development tab, and the testing tab.  
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class = "development reference">
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <div class = "indented expanation">
                This is the second phase of the 3 phases of the development process. This is where the gamification component comes into play.
                Each feature you added in the design phase will show up here with a corresponding checkbox. As you finish developing a feature, check the box, and your score will increase.
            </div>
            <div class = "indented explanation">
                For additional accessibility considerations as well as compliance, we have included the complete Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) as items to complete. 
                Here, you can audit your website as you are developing it, or soon after. 
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class = "testing reference">
            <h2>Testing</h2>
            <div class = "indented explanation">
                Testing is the last phase of the development process. It outlines both generic software testing as well as accessibility testing.
            </div>
            <div class = "indented explanation">
                In the specific feature testing section, you can ensure your features function properly.
            </div>
            <div class = "indented explanation">
                <h2>Accessibility Testing</h2>
                Accessibility Testing follows 3 phases: Automated, Expert, User. It's important they're done in this order.
                <div class = "indented explanation">
                    <h3>Automated Testing</h3>
                    <div class = "explanation indented">
                        There are several platforms developers can use to ensure their web content is accessible. Running your website through these will give you tons of insight.
                        These are to be run before you conduct expert or user testing. This is because automated testing is much cheaper, and can be ran at your convenience. 
                        If this isn't run before expert testing, you will waste the expert's time with basic issues you could have found in a few seconds with automated tools. 
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class = "indented explanation">
                    <h3>Expert Testing</h3>
                    <div class = "indented explanation">
                        Expert testing is getting a professional to generate a report on the accessibility of your website. This should be done after automated testing, 
                        so the expert's time is spent finding issues automated tools are not capable of finding. 
                    </div>
                    <div class = "indented explanation">
                        Our product allows you to submit all the issues the expert found and rank their severity as well. These issues will appear in the development phase.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class = "indented explanation">
                    <h3>User Testing</h3>
                    <div class = "indented explanation">
                        User testing is getting a differently-abled person to use your website. This should be done after last, 
                        so the user's unique perspective can be fully utilized, rather than finding issues experts, or worse, automated tools could find. 
                    </div>
                    <div class = "indented explanation">
                        Our product allows you to submit all the issues the user found and rank their severity as well. These issues will appear in the development phase.
